<hr>
<h3><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>The objective of Health Status Analyzer with self assessment platform is to allow the administrator of any authorized medical organization the ability to edit and find out the personal medical details of a patient and allows the patient to access his profile as well. It’ll also facilitate keeping all records of the patients, such as their id, name, mailing address, phone number, DOB etc. It will also include a patient’s medical history if or when was he diagnosed with any illness, what kind of treatment was he given etc so, all the information about him/her will be available in a few seconds. Overall, it’ll make patient medical data an easier job for the administrator of any organization.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to illustrate the requirements of the project Health Database system with self assessment platform and data visualization is intended to help any organization to access the necessary medical data of the patient. It is a comprehensive project developed from the ground up to fulfill the needs of the health sector in general aiming to unify the scattered data and organize it as per scientific norms. This integrated information management system also provides a Covid-19 self assessment platform which determines a person’s risk of contraction and exposure to the virus since visiting doctors directly without a medical necessity is not advised during the pandemic. It provides a single source of data repository for a patient s medical history. It has a simple user interface and is intuitive. This ensures that the users spend less time in learning the system and hence, increase their productivity.</p><br>
